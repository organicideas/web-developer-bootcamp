	<p>Did he speak to you? Would you just answer? What things? What people? A month ago, <span>Gus was trying to kill both of us</span>. And now, he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as... what... a, an assistant gunman? A tough guy? Does that make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you. What kind of game is he playing. Does he think you're that na√Øve? He can't truly think that you'd forget... let alone Gale, let alone Victor... and all the horror that goes along with all of that. </p>

	<p>It's enough. This is still the best way. You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive. But with this... you slip it into his food or drink, there shouldn't be any taste or smell... thirty-six hours later... poof. A man his age, working as hard as he does... no one will be surprised. Mike can have his suspicions, but that's all they'll be. Please, one homicidal maniac at a time. </p>
